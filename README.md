# Josephus Problem

## Background

The Josephus problem is a theoretical scenario named after the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. It involves a group of individuals arranged in a circle, where every nth person is eliminated until only one person remains. The problem seeks to determine the position in the circle where one should stand to be the last survivor. It has applications in computer science, particularly in data structures and algorithms, as well as in game theory. The problem can be solved using various mathematical approaches, including recursive formulas and modular arithmetic, providing insights into problem-solving strategies and algorithmic thinking.
